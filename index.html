You have just been notified that your father has been captured and killed during the war. You remember the overwhelming feeling of loneliness, despair and anger you felt as you realized your father, the person who you looked up to most in your life, who was always there for you when you needed him, had been taken away from the world in an instant. Fast forward 8 years. You stand in a row with only 9 other people, as General Fong, hands you your military uniform. You feel a sense of pride, as you follow in your father's footsteps to become one of the top ranked soldiers in your class. Go forward 2 more years, during the surrender of Omashu. As you see your family carted off in prison carts most likely to be sold as slaves. You turn to your left and see as most of the other soldiers are executed. You and you alone are taken prisoner out of the other 10,000 warriors stationed there. You feel guilt that you were the one to live, that you could not save your family. For the first time in your life you feel truly scared, because you do not want to die like your father, to leave your family behind. Suddenly you wake with a start, a cold sweat had accumulated all over your body. Your cellmate, an elderly non-bender glances over at you ‘Don't worry kid, everyone has a tough first night’ he says as he looks down at his steel bed. ‘You better be ready kid, newbies fight first.’ He says as a firebender soldier comes to the metal gate ‘Step outside pig’ he says while holding a plate of gruel. The old man gives you a saddened smile before patting you on the back ‘Good luck kid... You're gonna need it’. The soldier leads you through the prison to the fighting area gates. ‘Through these doors you will fight another prisoner to the death. The rules are simple. Rule 1 kill or be killed. Here's your breakfast swine’ he says before dropping your food onto the ground and walking out. You wait for what seems like hours before, the gates finally open. Walk through the gates? As you walk through the open doors you")
